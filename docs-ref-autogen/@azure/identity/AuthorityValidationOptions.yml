      The field determines whether instance discovery is performed when
      attempting to authenticate.

      Setting this to `true` will completely disable both instance discovery and
      authority validation.

      As a result, it's crucial to ensure that the configured authority host is
      valid and trustworthy.

      This functionality is intended for use in scenarios where the metadata
      endpoint cannot be reached, such as in private clouds or Azure Stack.

      The process of instance discovery entails retrieving authority metadata
      from https://login.microsoft.com/ to validate the authority.
